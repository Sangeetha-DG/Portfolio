## YouTube Video Recommendation using Twitter API || API, Python, R studio, Tableau || Sckit-Learn Mar 2023 -Jun 2023
I developed a robust recommendation system using Python that suggests transcribed video content to users across all Twitter topic categories. Ensured data reliability by
manually scraping data from Twitter API ((X platform)
• Processed and transformed the Tweets and YouTube text into data frame format using sci-kit learn, applied TF-IDF Vectorization, Preprocessed the data. Built large scale SQL
database system to store and manage scraped data efficiently.
• Implemented a cosine similarity algorithm to build a content-based recommendation system that suggests relevant video content based on the topic of the tweet. Utilized Power
BI to create interactive dashboard, visualization key insights and improving decision making for content recommendation. This system enhanced user experience by helping them
discover relevant and engaging video content on Twitter (X platform)
